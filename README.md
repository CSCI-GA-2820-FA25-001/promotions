## üìò Overview
This repository implements the **Promotions Microservice** for an e-commerce platform as part of  
**NYU CSCI-GA 2820 ‚Äì DevOps and Agile Methodologies (Homework 2: CI/CD and Kubernetes Deployment)**.

It demonstrates:
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** with GitHub Actions
- **Automated coverage reporting** with Codecov
- **Containerized deployment** using Docker and VS Code Dev Containers

The service supports full **CRUD**, **search**, and **role-based listing** for product promotions,  
achieving **‚â• 98 % coverage** (‚â• 95 % required).

---

## üß∞ Development Environment (VS Code + Docker)

This project uses **VS Code Remote ‚Äì Containers** and **Docker** to ensure a reproducible environment.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Remote ‚Äì Containers extension  

### Setup Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CSCI-GA-2820-FA25-001/promotions.git
cd promotions
code .
# When prompted, choose "Reopen in Container"
make build
make lint
make test
make run
````

Once running, the service will be available at **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)** inside the container.

---

## üß© Continuous Integration and Coverage

Every Pull Request triggers GitHub Actions to run `flake8`, `pylint`, and `pytest`.
Coverage reports are uploaded to **Codecov**, with badges above showing build and coverage status.

‚úÖ **Automatic CI/CD Pipeline**
‚úÖ **Linting Standards (PEP 8 ‚â§ 127 chars)**
‚úÖ **‚â• 95 % Coverage Threshold (Actual 98 %)**
‚úÖ **TDD Workflow validated via pytest + GitHub Actions**
